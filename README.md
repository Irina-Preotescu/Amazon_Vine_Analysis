# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze whether it would be worth it to subscribe to a Vine program if similar products were to be sold on the same platform. I used PySpark, PostgresSQL, Amazon Web Services, Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, and pandas for this analysis. I chose the US Apparel database.


## Results

Regarding the paid Vine program:

* 33 total reviews
* 15 5-star reviews
* 45% of Vine reviews were 5-star


Regarding the unpaid reviews:

* 45,388 total reviews
* 23,733 5-star reviews
* 52.3% of unpaid reviews were 5-star


## Summary

Customers are not biased.

For future analysis, we could use NLP to examine the text in each comment and review, as this might make a difference in the kind of message portrayed through the comments.
